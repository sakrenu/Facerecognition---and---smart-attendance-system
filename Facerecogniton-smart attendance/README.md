This project is about creating a smart attendence system using Machine Learning Algorithm
(KNeighboursClassifier).
There are two steps.
First is to collect data, that is to collect faces ie, face recognition.
Second step is to classify it. 

The folder contains source code for both of the above mentioned tasks.
The paths used in the code are local to my computer.
